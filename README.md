# Quartz Compositions

Various QC experiments

You can download Quartz Composer from [Apple's developer site] [1].

Most of the compositions are set up to use your camera as default input source for the image filter. If you don't have a camera you might want to add a static image instead from e.g. an Image patch.

## Compositions

### Bilateral filtering
* 1D kernel filtering
